# VinylApp-016 patch notes

> **Historical note:** This patch note predates the Groovefolio product rename. `VinylApp-###` remains the historical ticket prefix.


This overlay assumes VinylApp-041 is already applied/merged.

## What changed

- Added `lib/providers/repository_providers.dart` as the single import surface
  for all four repository interfaces/providers.
- Kept the existing generated providers next to their repositories; VinylApp-016
  does not duplicate or move provider definitions.
- Added `test/providers/repository_providers_test.dart` proving all four
  repository providers can be overridden through `ProviderContainer`.
- Updated project documentation to mark the repository-provider layer as
  complete in the VinylApp-016 change set.

```powershell

No new generated provider is introduced by this ticket, so build_runner should
only verify the existing generated files are current.
